## üèÉ Running
You can either run the Model Scheduler using the CRACO (recommended) or directly with the build scripts. Both methods may require environment variables depending on your situation:

- `PUBLIC_URL` - Most of the time, you won't need to declare this as CoderMerlin routes routes your port directly to your VAPOR url.

### üßô CoderMerlin
Using the build scripts on CoderMerlin is significantly easier than serving through a user-unique VAPOR port. To start, head into your CLI:

1. Add any required environment variables to `.env`
2. Build & Serve the app by executing `run`

### üñ•Ô∏è Personal Dev. Environment
When using CRACO to build & serve the app, you have two options. You can either run a development environment or build & run a production environment.

#### Development Environment

1. Add any required environment variables to `.env`
2. Serve a development environment by executing `npm run dev`

#### Production Environment

1. Build a production environment by executing `npm run build`
2. Serve a production environment by executing `npm run start`
